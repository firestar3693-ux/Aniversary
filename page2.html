<h1>Happy 1 Year Anniversary 😭✨💋🤌🏻</h1>

<p>
my cutw little chotuuuu shaitannnnn😭🎀💞💘
<br><br>
Can you believe it’s been one whole year already?
One year of chats that never felt enough, late replies that still felt special and missing each other while still feeling close in the cutest way 😗♥️
<br><br>
Even though we live nearby, life and families made us feel like we’re in a long‑distance story but honestly?
I kinda love how we made it work with just words, care, and so much understanding 😭👀✨
<br><br>
You’ve become my favorite notification, my comfort person and the reason my mood randomly changes for no reason.
Yesssssss you do that mrsssss😭🎀
<br><br>
I love how you care without trying, how you stay even when things get quiet and how you feel like home without even being here.
Distance never scared me, because you were always worth it 😗♥️
<br><br>
So here’s to us —
to more teasing, more late chats, more missing,
and one day less distance and more moments together 🤞👀✨
<br><br>
Happy 1st Anniversary, meri pyaruuu si jawn😭🕸️🎀
<br>
Stay mine!!!!!! because I’m not sharing you 😭👉🏻👈🏻
